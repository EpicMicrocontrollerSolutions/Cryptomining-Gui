# Cryptomining-Gui
A customized graphic user interface (GUI) for monitoring your cryptomining rigs

I design R shiny apps and I am offering to custom design R shiny apps for 20 people to monitor you cryptocurrency mining rigs. If you are like me, you get tired of flipping through websites to monitor your cryptomining rigs. I have a python script that pulls cryptomining information on your workers based on the API data provided by your pools.  The script runs in some specified time interval, 20 minutes in my case, and pushes the data securely to a cloud provider.  The information is then pulled live from the cloud provider into the R shiny app.

See my cryptomining rig example here, I mine ZEC (GPU), TZC (GPU), and BCN (CPU), I just launched this demo last night:

Your app can be password protected and only you can view it, or it could be public. The price will start at $30 USD, or equivalent in altcoins, and go up based on the level of customization. I can show you a better demo R shiny app if you are really interested. You will get 25 hours of viewing per month, forever, or we can do a monthly subscription if you need more time (you shouldn't).  


After payment to build the app, there are several options:
1.) I send you a python script and you put your cryptomining API information in. If you are good with computers, this is an option.
2.) For $20 extra dollars, or altcoin equivalent, I will program all the information into the python script and can have a computer run it for you at whatever time interval you'd like (5, 10, 15, 20, 60 mins etc).


Your mining pool must provide an API key unique to your worker or account for this app to work.  I cannot steal any of your information based on this API key, it just lets me pull data, which is why I offer to give you the python code if you are uncomfortable.
